      <p >  Now all of that may sound like some sort of far-away fantasy, but I assure you, it’s very real.</p>

      <p >   Thousands of people around the world have been using this plant's root to alleviate the most complex and dooming illnesses for hundreds of years.</p>
        
      <p >   And in this short letter I’m going to show you how it can OVERHAUL your body’s immunity from the cellular level up - no matter how old you are.</p>
        
      <p >  But just before I get into the details of this immunity breakthrough, you need to understand WHY your immunity weakens each year in the first place.</p>
   <h3 class="mt-4 mb-4">The truth is, your immunity has little to do with your <br class="desktop-break">diet, exercise, or genetics. </h3>
<p >No, the reason your immunity depletes as you age is simple:</p>  

<p > It’s because of your body’s built-in <span class="brown-text text-700"><i>‘Master Repair Mechanism’</i></span>... </p>  
    
<p > Which I’ll get into in just a moment. </p>  
    
<p > For now, I want you to think back to the last time you were <span class="underlined-text-black"><i>truly</i></span> confident in your health.</p>  
    
<p > Was it ten years ago?</p>  
    
<p > Twenty? </p>  
    
<p > Maybe even 30? </p>  
    
<p > The reason I ask is because you might feel like your body is ‘giving out’ on you as you grow older.</p>  
    
<p> And I’m here to tell you that’s no way to live. </p>  
    
<p > Before pollutants, heavy metals, big pharma, and environmental toxins...</p>  
    
<p > Human immunity used to get stronger with age.</p>  
    
<p > But today?</p>  
    
<p > The oldest members of our society are left behind as their bodies deteriorate faster and faster.</p>   
    
<p >  Which means that instead of enjoying life with your children, your significant other, and your friends...</p>  
    
<p > You’re too busy thinking about your health… and the consequences of getting sick in these precious years...</p>  
    
<p class="brown-text text-700"> You aren’t confident in your body’s ability to heal itself...</p>  
    
<p > And if you don’t make a change... </p>  
    
<p > You could risk spending the rest of your life reliant on the big-pharma funded healthcare system... </p>  
    
<p > In and out of doctors offices... </p>  
    
<p > And constantly thinking to yourself... </p>

<p>Skeptical?</p>

<p>I would be too.</p>
    
<p>  But that’s until you realize that there are over 40 studies <i>proving</i> its ability to quickly treat immune issues… </p>
    
<p>  Meaning you won’t spend the Winter sniffing, coughing, and waking up in cold sweats.</p>
    
<p>  The root also <i>increases</i> your natural healing ability - according to Kamal Patel, who was named one of the ‘most influential men in health and fitness’.</p>
    
<p>  So you <span class="underlined-text-black">won’t</span> have to rely on over-the-counter medicines, boring diets and strict regiments in order to have confidence in your immunity.</p>
    
<p>  And here’s the fascinating part:</p>
    
<p> In the 1930s, a book was published detailing <span class="underlined-text-black">hundreds</span> of accounts from Doctors and patients around the UK, who had relieved themselves of all types of ailments using the plant in this letter. </p>

    <h3> How Today’s Plant Breakthrough <i>Defeated</i> The Most <br class="desktop-break"> Successful Pathogen Of All Time</h3>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div class="container white-section">
   <p> Sometimes in my research I come across information that is downright <span class="brown-text text-700"><span class="underlined-text-brown">harrowing</span>.</span></p>
   <p>And today is no exception.</p>
   <p>While I was navigating online libraries and medical archives, I kept seeing the same book referenced across multiple studies. </p>
   <p>It was a book published in the 1930s titled:</p>
   <h3 class="mt-5 mb-5" style="font-style:italic; font-weight: 600;">The Doom of 150,000 People In Great Britain</h3>
<p>The book is not available to purchase <i>anywhere.</i> </p>
<p> I couldn’t find it on Amazon. On eBay. Or on any of the biggest online book stores.</p> 
<p> I then turned to archives and online PDF-banks.</p> 
<p> And I still couldn’t find it.</p>
<p> It seemed like the book had been totally ‘scrubbed’ from the internet - as if someone <span class="underlined-text-brown brown-text text-700">didn’t want me to find it.</span></p>
<p> But I wouldn’t give up. </p>
<p> Something told me that I needed to find out what was in this book.</p>
<p> So I continued my search.</p>
<p> And what I found <span class="underlined-text-brown brown-text text-700">shocked</span> me to my core.</p>
<p class="brown-text text-700" style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom:30px">The book detailed doctors notes, patients accounts, and testimonials showing today’s Plant <br class="desktop-break">Extract <span class="underlined-text-brown">reversing</span> numerous ailments and health issues. </p>
<p>It was written after a <span class="underlined-text-black">desperate attempt</span> was made to convince Britain’s Health Minister to consider today’s plant as a Nationwide remedy for Tuberculosis (TB) and other illnesses.</p>
<p> Here’s why. </p>
<p>  TB was RIFE in Great Britain during the 30s.</p> 
<p> How rife?</p>
<p> Well, in the beginning of the book, it’s mentioned that a person would die of TB every 13 minutes.</p>
<p> And if the Minister of Health had listened and pushed for today’s plant to be used as a treatment...</p>
<p> They would have prevented the deaths of over 150,000 British people.</p>

        <p> (According to the authors)</p>
<p> Unnerving, I know. </p>
<p> But the doctors and patients in the book knew one thing:</p>
<p> These plant roots were not just alleviating symptoms of poor immunity...</p> 
<p class="text-700"> But they were helping patients make full recoveries.</p>

<p class="brown-text s-text mb-5 " style="text-align:center;">-Chapter 1, Introduction</p>
<p>We’re talking cold, hard evidence that was read in the <span class="underlined-text-black">House of Commons</span> before the Minister of Health.</p>

                   <p class="small-text">If you paid attention in your high school biology class, you might remember that White Blood Cells (WBCs) protect your body against infections, diseases, and sickness.</p>
                   <p class="small-text">Simply put… </p>
                   <p class="small-text">WBCs act as an ‘army’ against unknown organisms that find their way into your system.  (Viruses, bacteria, pathogens, etc)</p>
                   <p class="small-text">They locate the site of an infection and fight the invading organism by producing antibody proteins to attach to the organism and destroy it.</p>

</div>

        </div>
        <p>Why is this relevant? </p>
        <p> Because your WBCs are the <span class="text-700 brown-text underlined-text-brown">core function</span> that allow you to fight off disease and sickness.</p>
        <p> And your WBCs are <span class="text-700 brown-text underlined-text-brown">produced</span> by your Parent Cells. </p>
        <p> And your body’s ability to produce Parent Cells - well, that’s what we call the <span class="text-700 brown-text underlined-text-brown">Master Repair Mechanism.</span></p> 
        <p> Can you see where I’m going with this, and why today’s letter is <span class="underlined-text-black">imperative</span> for your immune health?</p>
        <p> Let me explain.</p>
        <p> When you get ill, your body releases a signal, causing your Parent Cells to create White Blood Cells.</p>
        <p> These WBCs then find and neutralize foreign debris, bacteria, viruses, fungi while cleaning up damaged/dead cells. </p>
    </div>
</div>

<!-- They produce white blood cells  -->

</div>
<p>When you were young, your <span class="brown-text text-700 underlined-text-brown"><i>Master Repair Mechanism</i></span> was at its strongest. </p>
<p> That’s because your body had <span class="underlined-text-black">more</span> <span class="brown-text text-700 ">Parent Cells</span> circulating - so you were able to produce White Blood Cells more efficiently.</p>
    </div>
</div>

        <h3 style="font-weight:800; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 30px;" >Which is why you seemed to recover from injuries and illness much faster in your twenties.</h3>
    <p>Here’s the problem though. </p>
    <p> As you grow older, your body’s <span class="text-700 brown-text underlined-text-brown"><i>Master Repair Mechanism</i></span> weakens, so your Parent Cell count decreases.</p>
    <p> Meaning… </p>
    <p> Your body’s ability to produce <span class="underlined-text-black">White Blood Cells</span> becomes inhibited.</p>
    <p> (Because, as I mentioned earlier, these Parent Cells are what make your White Blood Cells)</p>
    <p> You’re probably starting to connect the dots.</p>
    <p class="text-700 brown-text"> Your body’s ability to produce White Blood Cells dwindles with age. </p>
    <p> And that is why your immunity seems to grow weaker with each year.</p>
    <p> Why ‘harmless’ ailments like the flu seem to hit you like a mule-kick to the gut, leaving you sniffing, coughing, and sneezing for weeks… </p>
    <p> It’s also why a healthy diet, strong training program, and good sleep are <i>NOT</i> enough to tackle your immunity problem - because they don’t target the <span class="underlined-text-black">root cause</span> of your weakening immune system… </p>
    <p> <span class="text-700 brown-text underlined-text-brown"><i>Master Repair Mechanism</i></span>.</p>
    <p> And mark my words - immunity isn’t the only problem you'll face with a weakened Master Repair Mechanism.</p>
    <p> Let me explain. </p>
    <p> Since your <span class="text-700 brown-text underlined-text-brown"><i>Master Repair Mechanism</i></span> can no longer keep up with your dying cells…</p> 
    <p> (your cells are constantly dying and replacing themselves)</p>
    <p> You’ll also start to age faster and faster… </p>
    <p> The skin around your neck and chin starts to become droopy… wrinkly and saggy…</p> 
    <p> Your bones and muscles become weaker…</p>
    <p> Your immune response becomes slower, and more sluggish…</p>
    <p> And potentially worst of all… </p>
    <p class="brown-text text-700"> The people you love the most start to view you as fragile and old.</p>
    <p> But let me be clear:</p>
    <p> I’m not trying to fear monger. I’m here to provide a solution.</p> 
    <p> Remember the ‘Parent Cells’ I mentioned earlier? </p>
    <p> The cells that create your White Blood Cells?</p>
    <p> Well… </p>
    </div>
</div>

        <p> Scientists around the globe are in a frenzy to find new ways to use these cells to help older folks recover from hundreds of illnesses… </p>
        <p> Because they believe that stem cells are the key to staying <span class="brown-text text-700">robust</span> as you age… </p>

        <p> Meaning, that by supercharging your <span class="brown-text text-700"><i>Master Repair Mechanism… </i></span></p>
        <p> You wouldn’t have to go through life wrapped in a ‘symbolic’ layer of bubble wrap… </p>

        <p> You’d be able to keep up with your hyperactive grandkids - chasing them around the garden, smiling at the innocent joy in their eyes.  </p>

   <p>In the highest altitudes of Mount Lesotho, South Africa, grows a magnificent plant named Umckaloabo.</p>
   <p>(Pronounced um-ka-loh-ah-bo)</p>
   <p>Because of the harsh environments of the region, the soil in which the plant grows is largely untouched by modern civilization. </p>

   <p>A <span class="underlined-text-black"><i>potent, effective</i></span> plant remedy, pure and devoid of any man made GMOs, toxins, and fertilizers. </p>
   <p>That’s why the locals have used it for <span class="underlined-text-black">hundreds of years</span> to help combat viral colds, flu, diarrhea, and respiratory tract infections.</p>
   <p>It’s also why I’ve brought you today's announcement. </p>
   <p>Because numerous studies have shown that ONE chemical in this plant can amplify your stem cell activity…</p>

  <p>You might find some cheap pills that ‘claim’ to be Umckaloabo…  </p>

    <p >We’re getting it STRAIGHT from the source.</p>
    <p> And when I tell you that we cut NO corners to bring you the most effective immune solution, I mean it.</p>
    <p> Here’s why… </p>
    <p>  Our dedicated harvesters use organic, non-commercial harvesting methods to extract the Umckaloabo roots from the earth without damaging the nutrients. </p>
    <p> They also replant 5 - 6 shavings of EACH plant root in order to maintain sustainable harvesting.</p>
    <p> We pay our harvesters EXTRA to operate in this manner.</p> 
    <p> That’s not all though.</p>
    <p> We pay out bonuses to the top harvesters at the end of each month.</p> 
    <p> So not only do we get to support the local economy… </p>
    <p> But we feel good knowing that we’re harvesting these plants in the most sustainable and earth-friendly way possible.</p>
    <p> After harvesting, suitable plant roots are transported down the mountain to a GMP certified processing facility, where every single plant root is carefully washed, dried and milled.</p> 
    <p> Then, in collaboration with local experts, we conduct lab tests to determine the potency and purity of the plant's chemicals.</p>
    <p> We then carefully extract each and every drop out of the plant in order to create what we call… </p>
